# MyMagicDataCode
This is the code I created in this repository "https://github.com/maxmusumeci/maxmagicmoney". 
The idea is that youtube videos about magic cards would affect the price of the digital versions of the cards if we could show this we may make a traading bot to capitalise if not it will be interesting analysis and data collection
I used a youtube api to get releases of videos corresponding deck lists and dates
I made a complicated webscraper to get the time series data for each of the cards in the deck lists
I made crude plots for the time series data around our vector(the video) 
More analysis is required more data is required we will have to fire up the web scraper again. 

to see the results look at the time_series_data_plots.docx
