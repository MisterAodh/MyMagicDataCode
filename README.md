# MyMagicDataCode
This is the code I created in this repository "https://github.com/maxmusumeci/maxmagicmoney". 
The Idea of this project is to see if we could use data collection techniques to show that the small volumn online commodities markets of mtgo can be exploited. 
I have created a set of programs with the youtube API and quite a complex webscraper to ascertain the data, In the future we will be building a trading bot and modelling it on this data these parts of the project will not be done solely be me and can be viewed on the repository unless we deem it too proprietory.
